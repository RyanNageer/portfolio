        <div class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Ryan Nageer. I am a CS graduate of FSU's Class of 2025. <br> I am currently working towards my Master's degree in Computer Science.
            My interests include software development, server management, web development, and scripting/automation. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently working as a Product & Software Engineer at the startup <a href="https://studeliver.com" class="underline-link">StuDeliver</a>.
            StuDeliver is a food delivery platform intended to be used by college students that has lower fees than traditional delivery services. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing Counter-Strike, working out, doing Leetcode and spending time with my friends and family. </div>
